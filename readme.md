# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression & Gradient Descent

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on the size of the house using linear regression and gradient descent.

## 📌 Features

- Implements cost function and gradient descent from scratch (no sklearn)
- Plots the cost function over training iterations
- Predicts the price of a house given its size

## 📊 Dataset

| Size (1000 sqft) | Price ($1000s) |
|------------------|----------------|
| 1.0              | 250            |
| 1.7              | 300            |
| 2.0              | 480            |
| 2.5              | 430            |
| 3.0              | 630            |
| 3.2              | 730            |

## 🧠 How it works

The model learns parameters `w` and `b` such that:
